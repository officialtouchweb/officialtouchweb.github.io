            <p>Happy New Year to my amazing, caring, and understanding friend!</p>
            <br>
            <p>As we step into a brand-new year, I can’t help but reflect on how much this year has meant to me—especially because it brought us together. From being classmates to becoming such strong, inseparable friends, I’m grateful for every moment we've shared. You’ve been such a special part of my life, and I truly appreciate everything you are. Your care, understanding, and the way you always have my back mean more than words can express. I’ll never forget that movie get-together we had—it was one of the best memories of the year! The laughter, the fun, and the bond we shared that day made me realize just how lucky I am to have you in my life. The way we tease "Target" will always bring a smile to my face, but what matters most is the incredible friendship we’ve built and the special connection we have. As we move into this new year, I want nothing more than for our bond to grow even stronger, deeper, and never-ending. You’re someone who makes my life brighter just by being in it, and I can't wait for all the adventures and moments we’ll share in the future. Thank you for being you, for your care, and for making my life better every single day. Here’s to an amazing year ahead with you by my side. Happy New Year, my dear friend. Let's make it unforgettable, just like the memories we've already made!
                Again from my bottom of my heart a very big HAPPY NEW YEAR... Love you Taran</p>
                <br>
